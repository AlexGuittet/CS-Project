# CS-Project

1. The most annoying problem I encountered during the project was image formatting. It was not mixing well with the text and the way I wanted to align the text in question. I had to work to format it so that it fit well. The specific code that helped with that was the following: "<div class="image2"> </div><img style="margin-left:780px;" style="float: right;" src="img"> <br></div></div>". With this, I could customize more or less where I wanted the image, which ended up working perfectly fine.

2. My understanding of computing has changed in every respect since the beginning of this semester. I have learned to understand a little bit about many different aspects of programming, including HTML, CSS, C, and JS. For example, I also learned some about how computers work and how characters are interpreted as ASCII codes by the computer; A = 65, B = 66, and so on.

3. Everything I can do now is something I couldn't do before. Now, I could make my own website, format it and make it look nice, and integrate another programming language, just as I have done for my final project. I've learned a lot about a variety of languages such as HTML, CSS, C, and JavaScript.

4. Computers are more or less behind everything we have. We use computers to develop products, conduct research, complete challenging tasks, and many more things. They help propel society forwards and are therefore something to be very grateful for.

5. We would have to participate in more hands-on activities as well as go outside more. We'd develop a better social life and a slightly more natural lifestyle that it prevented by the existence of computers.

6. I believe that it was a good base for my understanding of computer science. It's helpful because, considering it's the 21st century, it may affect my career choices. Maybe I make a decision to study computer science more indepth, and I may decide take that path for my career. I think that the class is important to a range of students living in this age.
